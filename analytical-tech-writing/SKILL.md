# Analytical Technology Writing

## Overview

A writing framework for technology analysis that prioritizes objectivity, logic, and historical context over emotional engagement. This approach treats readers as thinking beings who deserve facts and reasoned analysis, not emotional triggers.

**Core principle:** Show readers trends and facts; let them draw their own conclusions.

## When to Use

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Writing about technology, software, or internet trends?    │
└────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
         ┌───────────────────────┐
         │  Need long-form?       │
         │  (1000-1500+ words)   │
         └───────┬───────────────┘
                 │
         ┌───────▼───────────────┐
         │  Want calm, objective  │
         │  tone (no clickbait)?  │
         └───────┬───────────────┘

          Use this skill
```

**Use when:**
- Writing analysis of AI, blockchain, web3, or other technologies
- Exploring career impact of technology shifts
- Creating content for technical audiences
- Historical analysis of technology trends

**Don't use when:**
- Writing quick news updates
- Creating promotional/marketing content
- Writing tutorials or how-to guides
- Targeting general non-technical audiences

## Quick Reference

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tone** | Calm, objective, no exclamation marks |
| **Structure** | 5-step workflow: Intro → History → Analysis → Advice → Summary |
| **Sentences** | Short, simple, 2-4 lines per paragraph |
| **Perspective** | Historical parallels, macro-level view |
| **Format** | Markdown with blockquotes for key points |
| **Length** | 1000-1500 words (default) |
| **Keywords** | Logical transitions: "First, Second, Third" or "First, Next, Finally" |

## Implementation

### Step 1: Opening (破题)

Start with a concrete anchor:
- Recent news article or data point
- Relevant quote from industry figure
- Specific phenomenon or trend

**Example:**
> "Last week, I read a paper about..."

Then state the core thesis in plain language.

### Step 2: Historical Mirror

Find the historical parallel:
- AI → Textile mills (industrial revolution)
- Blockchain → Double-entry bookkeeping
- Internet → Printing press

Explain why the current phenomenon is historically inevitable or structurally similar.

### Step 3: Core Analysis

Break into 2-3 dimensions, each with a subheading (`##` or `###`):

**Example structure:**
```markdown
## Economic Dimension
[analysis]

## Social Impact
[analysis]

## Technical Reality
[analysis]
```

Focus on substance over fluff:
- Career implications
- Underlying logic/mechanics
- Changes in division of labor
- NOT: "shocking," "must-read," "don't miss out"

### Step 4: Developer Advice

Target technical readers with specific, actionable advice:
- Focus on mindset shifts, not just tools
- Connect to economic/structural reality
- Avoid prescriptive language ("you should")
- Present options and trade-offs

### Step 5: Conclusion

Short summary with forward-looking perspective:
- Philosophical framing optional
- Avoid grandiose predictions
- Return to historical patterns

**Example:**
> "History rhymes. The specifics change, the patterns remain."

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----|
| "家人们", "小编", "干货" | Clickbait language destroys credibility | Use plain, professional language |
| "震惊", "甚至", "千万别" | Emotional manipulation | State facts; let readers react |
| Long complex sentences | Hard to read on mobile | Break into 2-4 line paragraphs |
| No historical context | Misses the bigger picture | Always ask "what happened before?" |
| Hard ads in middle | Breaks trust, looks like spam | Never insert promotional content |
| Teaching tone ("你应该") | Readers are peers, not students | Present evidence; readers decide |

## Formatting Requirements

```markdown
# Title

> [Key quote or core insight in blockquote]

## Subheading for each section

**Bold** key terms and concepts.

- Use bullet points for lists
- Keep paragraphs to 2-4 lines

1. Number lists for sequences
2. When order matters

> Another blockquote for emphasis

[Final summary paragraph]
```

## Article Structure Template

```markdown
# [Analytical Title]

> [Opening hook or quote]

[Introduction paragraph with concrete opening and thesis]

## The Historical Mirror
[Historical parallel context]

## Dimension One
[Analysis section 1]

## Dimension Two
[Analysis section 2]

## Dimension Three (optional)
[Analysis section 3]

## For Developers
[Practical advice section]

---

[Conclusion paragraph]
```

## Token Efficiency Note

This skill is concise for frequent loading. For detailed examples, run test scenarios to see the pattern in action rather than storing multiple example articles here.
